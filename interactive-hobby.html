        <h2>About The Puzzler</h2>
        <p>I'm someone who thrives on curiosity and creativity. Whether I'm working on a new project, 
          learning a new skill, or simply exploring ideas, I enjoy diving deep and finding meaning in 
          the details. I believe in staying open to growth, both personally and professionally, and 
          I’m always looking for ways to push myself a little further outside my comfort zone.</p>

        <p>Professionally, I’ve had the opportunity to gain experience across a range of roles, where 
          I've developed strong communication, problem-solving, and organizational skills. I'm 
          passionate about building meaningful connections, whether that's through collaborative 
          work, storytelling, or simply listening and learning from others. I take pride in being 
          reliable, adaptable, and driven by purpose.</p>
        
          <p>Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, doing puzzles, and cooking, and I find balance 
            by making time for the things that energize me. I value authenticity and try to 
            bring a thoughtful, grounded approach to everything I do. Life is always evolving, 
            and I'm here for the journey.</p>
